# promviz

`promviz` is a command-line tool to visualize the Prometheus metrics in CLI. We have forked prometheus and reused the code to create this new tool. The tool is available in the `cmd/promviz` directory alongside the `cmd/prometheus` (TSDB) and `cmd/promtool`. The tool is in `alpha` stage and is not yet ready for production use. The project was created by [@chtushar] and [@pushkar-anand] as a part of the [FOSSHack 2024 hackathon](https://fossunited.org/fosshack/2024).
